# IntelligentRobot
the research direction of intelligent robot

## goal: intelligent robot

three steps to complete it:

1\ intelligent robot(People input task)

2\ Turing test(text only input)

3\ voice and vision input (like human)

step 1: human input tasks and all the infos that tasks need. robot successfully execute tasks, including moving, location, execption things(eg: avoid obstacle, fall prevention ...), extension and knowledge transfer ability(eg: robot change workplace, can quickly execute task. don't need to input a lot of infos again by human, only some different infos). robot have auto-study ability. 

step 2: robot pass Turing Test(text only input)

step 3: robot can communicate with human, and can recognition people gesture

## current situation

robot compare with human when executing task

|    | robot | human
|:----:|:------:|:-------:
|inputing: | use keyboard and mouse and input program to get task info | language and teaching and training meeting to get task info
| | strengths: 1\memory well 2\ easily share task infos with other robot | strengths: good extension ability and knowledge transfer ability(eg: after first detail training meeting, people can deal with similar situation)
| | weaknesses: once situation is changed, need to input all infos again | weaknesses: 
|execution: | strengths: efficiency/don't need rest | strengths: 1\flexible(behavior/deal with problem) 2\auto study ability 3\deal with exception problem and emergency
| | weaknesses: | weaknesses: slack and tired easily 

let's use inspection robot as a example to analyse robots' problem.

1\ location

2\ emergence handing (eg: avoid obstacle and fall prevention etc)

solution:
 
1\ considering all the emergence situation

2\ auto study and judge ability
